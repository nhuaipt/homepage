Commit: save the state of your project in Git

A repository is a directory which contains your project.
Repositories can exist either locally on your computer or as a remote copy on another computer. 
A repository is made up of commits.

The Working Directory is the files that you see in your computer's file system.

Staging Area / Staging Index / Index
A file in the Git directory that stores information about what will go into your next commit.
When a commit is made, only the changes that are in the Staging Index are saved in the repository.

SHA
A SHA is basically an ID number for each commit. 
Here's what a commit's SHA might look like: e2adf8ae3e2e4ed40add75cc44cf9d0a869afeb6.

Branch
A branch is when a new line of development is created that diverges from the main line of development. 
This alternative line of development can continue without altering the main line.

Checkout
A checkout is when content in the repository has been copied to the Working Directory.
